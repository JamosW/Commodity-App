# Commodity-App

This is an app to visualize data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) that is readily available which can be found [here.](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)

Originally this app was conceptualized as a means to visualize the time series of traded commodities in tandem with FAO data on commodites and their origin.
Embarking upon the process of creating the app, it became apparent that getting something simple as traded commodities and their historical data required shelling out 
a sizable amount of money.

As the app currently stands, it is a lightweight app under active development with the purpose of visualizing FAO data and presenting some time-series data on the
public and free data on traded agricultural commodities.
