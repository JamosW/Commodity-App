This is an app to visualize data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) that is readily available which can be found [here.](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)

As the app currently stands, it is a lightweight app with the purpose of visualizing FAO data and presenting some time-series data on the
public and free data on traded agricultural commodities.
